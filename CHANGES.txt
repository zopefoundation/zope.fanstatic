0.9b (2011-01-06)
-----------------

Zope.fanstatic version 0.9 is a fundamental rewrite of `hurry.zoperesource`_,
as a result of the rewrite of `hurry.resource`_ into `fanstatic`_.

Here's a list of essential changes since version 0.7 of hurry.zoperesource:

- Compliance with the Fanstatic API.

- ``++resource++foo/bar/baz.jpg`` expressions in Page Templates are
  still supported by way registering a traversable component for all
  available resource libraries. There are no zope.browserresource
  components involved anymore in zope.fanstatic.
