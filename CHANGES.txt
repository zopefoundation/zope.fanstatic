0.11 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Fix bug where calling `ensure_base_url()` failed for `DummyNeededResources`
  objects. This was problematic when writing functional or "browser" tests
  of applications that depend on fanstatic/zope.fanstatic.

0.10 (2011-04-11)
-----------------

- Update to fanstatic 0.11 API.

0.9.1 (2011-01-20)
------------------

- Do not clear resources on DummyNeededResources objects.

0.9 (2011-01-20)
----------------

- Integrate zope.errorview, subscribing to the HandleExceptionEvent. This will
  clear the needed resources thusfar required, to have a clean slate for the
  error view to be rendered.

0.9b (2011-01-06)
-----------------

Zope.fanstatic version 0.9 is a fundamental rewrite of `hurry.zoperesource`_,
as a result of the rewrite of `hurry.resource`_ into `fanstatic`_.

Here's a list of essential changes since version 0.7 of hurry.zoperesource:

- Compliance with the Fanstatic API.

- ``++resource++foo/bar/baz.jpg`` expressions in Page Templates are
  still supported by way registering a traversable component for all
  available resource libraries. There are no zope.browserresource
  components involved anymore in zope.fanstatic.
